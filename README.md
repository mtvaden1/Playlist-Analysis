# Playlist-Analysis

This repository is an attempt to anaylze my Spotify playlists using various predictive ML models. There are two potential impacts:

1. When subsetting my playlists and attempting to predict what songs belong, the first question to consider is whether models successfully predict any songs from my test set that are on the playlist.

2. The second question to consider is how similar the predicted songs are to Spotify's recommended songs in an attempt to better understand the company's algorithm and hopefully find some new songs!
